💡 Overview

This project demonstrates how I built a fully automated workflow for a client who was manually editing thousands of images every day. The automation replaced a labor-intensive process, resulting in over ₹2,00,000/month in cost savings.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Puppeteer – Automated browser control for uploading, navigating, and interacting with web tools
	•	Segment Anything Model (SAM) – AI-based image segmentation and masking (e.g., hair, shoes)
	•	UploadThing – Seamless file handling between local and web environments

🧩 Problem

The client was manually performing the following tasks on a daily basis:
	•	Uploading thousands of images
	•	Manually masking features like hair and shoes
	•	Prompting AI models for editing
	•	Downloading the processed results

This consumed significant time and operational cost.

⚙️ Solution

I developed a bot that automates the entire workflow from start to finish:
	•	Automatically uploads images
	•	Applies AI-based masking using SAM
	•	Downloads the final processed images

The full solution was built in 5 days and is now running end-to-end without manual intervention.

📈 Impact
	•	Eliminated hours of daily manual work
	•	Saved over ₹2,00,000/month in manual labor
	•	Scalable and adaptable to similar repetitive workflows in other domains

🚀 Vision

This project reflects my strong interest in turning repetitive tasks into efficient, scalable AI-driven workflows. I aim to continue building systems that save time, reduce costs, and improve productivity through automation.
